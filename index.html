					<aside class="notes full-script">
						So why am I telling you all this? Well as I've learned, it's important to understand the cultural background of where I'm
						coming from. As we get into some definitions, I'm going to be speaking about DevOps in the CAMS model sense of the
						term: Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						When I say "enterprise," I'm going to be talking about organizations whose business is not software, or even IT, but whose
						IT department or division is focused on supporting the business operations of the organization as a whole. In my case,
						that means anything from the payroll and HR systems, to classroom and lab computers and printers, to the on-campus
						network.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						When I talk about "legacy," I'm thinking of the "traditional" ways that IT organizations have operated: Things like on-prem
						datacenters and software, physical servers, or what I like to call "pre-scaled" hardware, projet-centric planning,
						and a traditional org structure.

					<h1>Story Time</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						OK, so story time. All the way back in 2013, I was working at a small energy efficiency software company, doing some pretty
						cool stuff. In addition to being on the dev team, I was also "the" ops guy for most of my time there, and managed to
						get things like configuration management and automated deployments in place. Unfortunately, as is sometimes the case,
						I outgrew that small company and decided it was time to move up. So I looked around, and found something that really
						piqued my interest.

				<section>
					<h1>Opportunity</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						I saw an organization struggling to keep up with its users' expectations. Described as "backwater", with an Online Application
						for Graduate Admission that was, and I quote, "so bad, I almost didn't apply." And I saw the potential of being able
						to help make everything better. After all, I'd participated in and seen first-hand how things like configuration management
						and continuous delivery could do. As my start date approached, I got myself all amped up, right? "I'm gonna turn this
						ship around. I'm going in with guns blazing!"

						<li>HTTP connections</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						Has anyone worked with PL/SQL before? So PL/SQL is what happens when Oracle thinks it's a good idea for your database to
						also handle all your application logic. This includes everything from filesystem I/O, to LDAP management, to HTTP connections.
						The one thing it doesn't do, out of the box, is automated testing. So, what was one of the first things I wrote when
						I came on board? A lightweight automated testing library so that the team could start writing tests against their code.

					<h1>Team Dynamics Are Important</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						The flip side of that is that team dynamics are important, and just because I didn't work well on the ERP team didn't make
						me a bad developer, and it didn't make anyone else on the team a bad developer, it just wasn't the best fit. And I'm
						glad that management saw that as well, because I don't know how long I would have lasted otherwise. And so, I got moved
						to the web team, and that's when things started moving along.
