							So, not that we were *that* big, but it was still a culture shock for me that things moved so slowly. Obviously

							a couple months back, and he mentioned how it took them two years to get TypeScript approved as a language that could

						<small class="full-script">
							But why though? Well, with legacy enterprise organizations, and by that I mean enterprise organizations who haven't really
							embraced "the new way" yet, it's because they value stability over innovation. In some cases, that's with good cause,
							right? How many of you would be upset if you didn't get your paycheck because the payroll system crashed on payday
							after an upgrade? Research is starting to show that you can have both stability and innovation, but it's hard to get there,
							and so stability wins and innovation languishes. Similarly, when setting up a new system means budgeting for new hardware,
							you're limited in how fast you can roll new things out. I also mentioned the project-centric nature of legacy organizations,
							and this is another contributor to the falling behind: if it's not a capital P project, it doesn't have the priority.

							Projects, by definition, have a beginning and an end. Software, as many are still discovering, is constantly evolving. Yes,

							This is my home office. Things had to be done in a very specific order. For the ceiling alone, that meant electical wiring,
							followed by lights, then insulation, resilient channel, A/V wiring, drywall, taping, primer, paint, crown molding.
							If I forgot a step and moved on, it would be very difficult and expensive to remedy. And so you do the planning up-front
							to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and do things right the first time. This is waterfall development, right?
							And in the days of shrinkwrapped software, that's how it had to be done, because once you physically shipped, there
							was no turning back. But we're not in that time anymore, and so we need our processes to adjust accordingly.

							Has anyone worked with PL/SQL before? I hadn't either, before being hired as an Enterprise Application Developer for the
							Enterpise Resource Planning (or ERP) team. So PL/SQL is what happens when Oracle thinks it's a good idea for your database
							to also handle all your application code. This includes everything from filesystem I/O, to LDAP management, to HTTP
							connections. The one thing it doesn't do, out of the box, is automated testing. So, what was the first thing I wrote

							I get it. Right out of college, 2007, I didn't see the point of spending more time writing more code for something I could

							wasn't until I saw that first failing test in unrelated code, that the value really hit me. Now, this resistance doesn't
							usually come in the form of active refusal so much as it does apathy towards being forced to change long-lived habits.

						<small class="full-script">
							It was around this time that the term "Bimodal IT" found its way to our organization. "Bimodal IT" comes from Gartner, and
							is the idea that in order to succeed in the new world of user expectations, your IT organization neds to operate two
							different ways in parallel. Mode 1 is for your traditional, predictable service requests, Mode 2 is for when there
							are more unknowns and iteration is necessary. This immediately raised two red flags for me. Number one: while this
							seems reasonable for a legacy organization, for me, coming from the other direction, I was like "hold up, why isn't
							everything Mode 2? If it's predictable, it should be automated, and then becomes an exploration of how best to automate."
							Number two is the false dichotomy that speed and stability are a trade-off. Again, research is showing that it's not: you
							can do both. It's hard, but you can have both speed and stability. So while Bimodal IT may be a good first step for those
							just getting started, it seemed like a step backwards from my past experience, and I tried to be share my point of view
