				<aside class="notes">
					Good afternoon, happy Hacktoberfest! I'm Steve, and I'm going to tell you a story about how I helped promote DevOps to improve
					an IT department's performace.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Story Time</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					Many years ago, after doing some cool DevOps-y stuff at a small company, it was time to look for a new job. One position
					in particular cauight my eye, not because of the cool stuff they were doing, but because I saw an organization struggling
					to keep up with expectations.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Opportunity</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					And I saw the potential of using my first-hand DevOps experience make everything better. I was all like "Yeah! I'm gonna
					turn this ship around! I'm going in with guns blazing!"
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Do Not Go In
					<br/> With Guns Blazing
				</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					But there's a reason things are the way they are, and it's probably not by accident: legacy enterprise organizations value
					stability over innovation.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Stability
					<s>over</s> Innovation</h2>
				<h1>&amp;</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					But we're learning that you can have both stability and innovation, and that a culture of automation, metrics, and sharing
					is the way to get there.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Lead By Example</h1>
				<h2>"Be the CAMS model!"</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					We talk a lot obout DevOps, but sometimes talk isn't enough to spark change. So exhibit what you'd like the culture to grow
					to. Automate all the things. Measure the gains you're making. Most imporantly, share your successes, and your failures.
					Be the CAMS model!
				</aside>

				<h3>
					<b>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</b>
				</h3>
				<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
				<p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
					<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
					<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
					<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					This is the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Everyone always focuses on the 4 bullet points, but I want to point
					out that first sentence. "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."
					They're talking about experimentation.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/osxci.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Here's one such experiment: I found a spare machine, literally sitting in an empty office, and turned it into our first CI
					server. As our number of pipelines grew, we were able to show its value, and eventually got a real server for it.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/footprints.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Footprints is your run-of-the-mill legacy/enterprise ticketing system, where all our work was tracked. Just filling out the
					form to get something deployed was a whole ordeal in itself. So what did we do?
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/slack.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					ChatOps, of course! We experiemented and automated our way to even include things like notifications for auditing, sowing
					the seeds for continuous delivery.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/fox-in-socks.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					"Now wait a minute, Mr. Socks Fox" you might be saying, "you can't just willy-nilly deploy updates to an enterprise system
					over Slack!" And you're probably right, but we didn't do that.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Decouple from your Enterprise Systems</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-gradapp.png" alt="Graduate Application" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					We started rebuilding apps, with Angular and Bootstrap and REST APIs, and most importantly, with minimal hooks into the enterprise
					systems. By decoupling the application from the underlying database, we minimized risk and reduced complexity.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Extend via Configuration,
					<br/> Don't Fork Vendor Code
				</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-icpeers.png" alt="Private Social Network" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					It was almost impossible to upgrade one of our apps because of all the customizations added to the underlying framework.
					We pulled all that out into configurable modules that could be plugged into the platform, and upgrades suddently became
					a breeze.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Look for Low-Hanging Fruit</h2>
				<img src="images/banner-self-service.png" alt="Student Self-Service" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					Sometimes small changes can have a big impact. The self-service system, where students register for classes, check their
					grades and degree progress, even select their housing, was a specific source of pain for the campus.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/lthc.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					So much so that a student created a Chrome extension to improve the UI. I thought this was great, though unfortunately a
					Chrome extension doesn't scale to 10,000 users running a dozen different browsers.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/homerconnect2.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					So I spent two days restyling the app to have a mobile-friendly responsive design. The new CSS lived on a separate server,
					so the enterprise code didn't need to get touched.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Lead Times</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>ERP: 2-7 days</li>
					<li>Web: 5-20 minutes</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					By doing all of these things, we achieved crazy fast lead times compared to the traditional "over-the-wall" approach, which
					also meant we could now deploy multiple times per day.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Lead by example (be the CAMS model!)</h2>
				<h2>Experiment</h2>
				<h2>Decouple, Decouple, Decouple</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					So exhibit the culture you want to see evolve; experiment, even if that means needing to do it under the radar; and decouple
					as much as you can to make changes easier and less risky.
