				<aside class="notes full-script">
					So why am I telling you all this? Well as I've learned, it's important to understand the cultural background of where I'm
					coming from. As we get into some definitions, I'm going to be speaking about DevOps in the CAMS model sense of the term:
					Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing.

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					When I say "enterprise," I'm going to be talking about organizations whose business is not software, or even IT, but whose
					IT department or division is focused on supporting the business operations of the organization as a whole. In my case,
					that means anything from the payroll and HR systems, to classroom and lab computers and printers, to the on-campus network.

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					When I talk about "legacy," I'm thinking of the "traditional" ways that IT organizations have operated: Things like on-prem
					datacenters and software, physical servers, or what I like to call "pre-scaled" hardware, projet-centric planning, and
					a traditional org structure.

				<h1>Story Time</h1>

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					OK, so story time. All the way back in 2013, I was working at a small software shop, doing some pretty cool stuff. Unfortunately,

					something that really piqued my interest.

				<h1>Opportunity</h1>

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					I saw an organization struggling to keep up with its users' expectations. Described as "backwater", with an Online Application
					for Graduate Admission, and I quote, "so bad, I almost didn't apply." And As my start date approached, I got myself
					all amped up, right? "I'm gonna to help turn this ship around. I'm going in with guns blazing!"
