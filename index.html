				<aside class="notes">
					Good afternoon! I'm Steve, and I'm here to tell you a story about how I promoted DevOps in a legacy organization, legacy
					meaning the traditional, over-the-wall interactions between dev and ops.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Story Time</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					Many years ago, after doing some cool DevOps-y stuff at a small SaaS company, it was time to look for a new job. One position
					in particular cauight my eye, and I saw something:
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Opportunity</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					I saw an organization struggling to keep up with expectations. And I saw the potential of using my first-hand DevOps experience
					make everything better. I was all like "Yeah! I'm gonna turn this ship around! I'm going in with guns blazing!"
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Do Not Go In
					<br/> With Guns Blazing
				</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					But there's a reason things are the way they are, and it's probably not by accident: legacy enterprise organizations value
					stability over innovation.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<ul>
					<li>Stability over Innovation</li>
					<li>Control change vs embrace it</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					One way they do this is by controlling change, rather than embracing it. In some cases, that's with good cause, because I
					know how many of you would be upset if you didn't get your paycheck due to a bad patch.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Lead By Example</h1>
				<h2>"Be the CAMS model!"</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					But we're learning that you can do both, and that DevOps culture is the way to do that. Exhibit what you'd like the culture
					to grow to. Automate all the things. Measure the gains you're making. Most imporantly, share your successes, and your
					failures. Be the CAMS model!

				<h3>
					<b>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</b>
				</h3>
				<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
				<p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
					<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
					<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
					<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					This is the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Everyone always focuses on the 4 bullet points, but I want to point
					out that first sentence. "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."
					They're talking about experimentation.

				<aside class="notes">
					This is Go the CD tool, running on a spare machine under my desk, brought back to life as a prototype CI server, because
					it was less effort than procuring a new server for the physical datacenter. Once we were able to show its value, we
					got a real server for it.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/footprints.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					Footprints is your run-of-the-mill legacy/enterprise ticketing system, where all our work was tracked. Just filling out the
					form to get something deployed was a whole ordeal in itself. So what did we do?
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/slack.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					ChatOps, of course! I ask Todd, our ops guy, to update an app to a given tag, and it gets deployed. What you don't see is
					all the automated behind-the-scenes stuff, from tests running to notifications for auditing. All this is sowing the
					seeds for continuous delivery.

			<section data-background-image="images/fox-in-socks.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					"Now wait a minute, Mr. Socks Fox" you might be saying, "you can't just willy-nilly deploy updates to an enterprise system
					over Slack!" And you're probably right. But we didn't do that.
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h2>Decouple from your Enterprise Systems</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-gradapp.png" alt="Graduate Application" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					We started rebuilding apps, with Angular and Bootstrap and REST APIs, and most importantly, with minimal hooks into the enterprise
					systems. By decoupling the application from the underlying database, we minimized risk and reduced complexity.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Extend via Configuration,
					<br/> Don't Fork Vendor Code
				</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-icpeers.png" alt="Private Social Network" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					It was almost impossible to upgrade one of our apps because of all the customizations added to the underlying framework.
					We pulled all that out into configurable modules that could be plugged into the platform, and upgrades suddently became
					a breeze.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Look for Low-Hanging Fruit</h2>
				<img src="images/banner-self-service.png" alt="Student Self-Service" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					Sometimes small changes can have a big impact. The self-service system, where students register for classes, check their
					grades and degree progress, even select their housing, was a specific source of pain for the campus.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="images/lthc.png" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					So much so that one student, a freshman at the time, Aaron Zufall, created a Chrome extension to improve the UI. I thought
					this was great, though unfortunately a Chrome extension doesn't scale to 10,000 users running a dozen different browsers.
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="images/homerconnect2.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
				<aside class="notes">
					So I spent two days restyling the app to have a mobile-friendly responsive design. The CSS lived on a separate server, so
					this was low-risk because the database code didn't need to get touched, low-cost because it was just a couple days,
					and high-value because we knew that this was a big issue for students.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Lead Times</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>ERP: 2-7 days</li>
					<li>Web: 5-20 minutes</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					By doing all of these things -- decoupling our apps, continuous integration, constant communication with ops -- we achieved
					crazy fast lead times compared to the traditional "over-the-wall" approach, which also meant we could deploy multiple
					times per day, compared to just a couple times a week.

				<ol>
					<li>Lead by example (be the CAMS model!)</li>
					<li>Experiment</li>
					<li>Decouple, Decouple, Decouple</li>
				</ol>

				<aside class="notes">
					A quick review of things you can do to promote DevOps at your legacy org: exhibit the culture you want to see evolve; experiment,
					even if that means needing to do it under the radar; and decouple as much as you can to make changes easier and less
					risky.

					Again, I'm Steve, I help teams build better software. I have all this in physical form, if you want to bring a souvenir back
					for your boss. If you're more of a sticker person, I've got some Scotch tape, so you can stick it on your laptop, like
					this. Thank you!
