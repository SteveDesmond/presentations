							and managed to get things like configuration management, automated deployments, and continuous delivery in place. Unfortunately,

							So, not that we were *that* big, but it was still a culture shock for me that things moved so slowly. Obviously
							we weren't Google, but even Google has this problem. Rob Wormald, from their Angular team, gave a talk at Microsoft Build
							a couple months back, and he mentioned how it took them two years to get TypeScript approved as a language that could
							be used company-wide. So if you're part of a big org, and things are moving slow, you're not alone, it's apparently

					<li>Project-centric planning</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>but why though?</li>
						<li>legacy enterprise orgs (define) value stability over innovation</li>
						<li>one way = controlling change (rather than embracing)</li>

						<li>budgeting + provisioning hardware limits rollout</li>
						<li>not capital P project = doesn't have priority</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							But why though? Well, with legacy enterprise organizations, and by that I mean enterprise organizations who haven't really
							embraced "the new way" yet, it's because they value stability over innovation. One of the ways they do this is by controlling
							change, rather than embracing it. In some cases, that's with good cause, right? How many of you would be upset if you didn't
							get your paycheck because the payroll system crashed on payday after an upgrade? Research is starting to show that you can have
							both stability and innovation, but it's hard to get there, and so stability wins and innovation languishes. Similarly, when setting
							up a new system means budgeting for new hardware, you're limited in how fast you can roll new things out. I also mentioned the
							project-centric nature of legacy organizations, and this is another contributor: if it's not a capital P project, it doesn't have
							the priority.

							Projects, by definition, have a beginning and an end. Software, as many are still discovering, is organic, constantly evolving,

							This is my home office. Things had to be done in a very specific order. For the ceiling alone, that meant electical wiring,
							followed by lights, then insulation, resilient channel, A/V wiring, drywall, taping, primer, paint, crown molding.
							If I forgot a step and moved on, it would be very difficult and expensive to remedy. And so you do the planning up-front
							to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and do things right the first time. This is waterfall software development,
							and in the days of shrinkwrapped software, that's how it was done, because the cost to ship -- physically ship -- was so high,
							and once you shipped, there was no turning back. But we're not in that time anymore, and so we need our processes to adjust accordingly.
							What if I could have moved in right away, been able to work, slid the floor in under my desk, painted the walls when I had time, not had
							to deal with any drywall dust? How different would my process have been?

							Has anyone worked with PL/SQL before? I hadn't either, before being hired here. So PL/SQL is what happens when Oracle
							thinks it's a good idea for your database to also handle all your application code. This includes everything from filesystem
							I/O, to LDAP management, to HTTP connections. The one thing it doesn't do, out of the box, is automated testing. So, what was

							Angular and Bootstrap and REST APIs, and most importantly, with minimal hooks into the enterprise system. By decoupling the application
							from the underlying database, we minimized risk, we abstracted away the complexity into a more modern API, and we were able to develop with agility.
