					<small class="full-script">
							OK, so story time. All the way back in 2013, I had been working at a small energy efficiency software company for a few years,
							doing some pretty cool stuff. In addition to being on the dev team, I was also *the* ops guy for most of my time there,
							and managed to get things like configuration management, automated deployments, and continuous delivery in place. Unfortunately, 
							as is sometimes the case, I outgrew that small company and decided it was time to move on. So I looked around, and found something
							that really piqued my interest.

					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							I saw an organization struggling to keep up with its users' expectations. Self-described as "backwater", with an Online Application
							for Graduate Admission that was, and I quote, "so bad, I almost didn't apply." And I saw the potential of being able to help make
							everything better. After all, I had first-hand experience in how to improve software quality and team performance. And as my start
							date approached, I got myself more and more amped up. I was all like "Yeah! I'm gonna turn this ship around! I'm going in with guns blazing!"

						<li>Not alone, just nature of beast</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							So, not that we were *that* big, but it was still a culture shock for me that things moved so slowly. Obviously
							we weren't Google, but even Google has this problem. Rob Wormald, from their Angular team, gave a talk at Microsoft Build
							a couple months back, and he mentioned how it took them two years to get TypeScript approved as a language that could
							be used company-wide. So if you're part of a big org, and things are moving slow, you're not alone, it's apparently
							just the nature of the beast.

				<h1>Why?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Stability over innovation</li>
					<li>Control change vs embrace it</li>
					<li>Physical scaling limitations</li>
					<li>Project-centric planning</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>but why though?</li>
						<li>legacy enterprise orgs (define) value stability over innovation</li>
						<li>one way = controlling change (rather than embracing)</li>
						<li>payday example</li>
						<li>research = can have both, but hard, so S wins + I languishes</li>
						<li>budgeting + provisioning hardware limits rollout</li>
						<li>not capital P project = doesn't have priority</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							But why though? Well, with legacy enterprise organizations, and by that I mean enterprise organizations who haven't really
							embraced "the new way" yet, it's because they value stability over innovation. One of the ways they do this is by controlling
							change, rather than embracing it. In some cases, that's with good cause, right? How many of you would be upset if you didn't
							get your paycheck because the payroll system crashed on payday after an upgrade? Research is starting to show that you can have
							both stability and innovation, but it's hard to get there, and so stability wins and innovation languishes. Similarly, when setting
							up a new system means budgeting for new hardware, you're limited in how fast you can roll new things out. I also mentioned the
							project-centric nature of legacy organizations, and this is another contributor: if it's not a capital P project, it doesn't have
							the priority.

					<small class="full-script">
							Projects, by definition, have a beginning and an end. Software, as many are still discovering, is organic, constantly evolving,
							like a garden, and as such, should not be constrained to the same rules as construction. While this may be easy for some to grasp,

					<small class="full-script">
							This is my home office. Things had to be done in a very specific order. For the ceiling alone, that meant electical wiring,
							followed by lights, then insulation, resilient channel, A/V wiring, drywall, taping, primer, paint, crown molding.
							If I forgot a step and moved on, it would be very difficult and expensive to remedy. And so you do the planning up-front
							to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and do things right the first time. This is waterfall software development,
							and in the days of shrinkwrapped software, that's how it was done, because the cost to ship -- physically ship -- was so high,
							and once you shipped, there was no turning back. But we're not in that time anymore, and so we need our processes to adjust accordingly.
							What if I could have moved in right away, been able to work, slid the floor in under my desk, painted the walls when I had time, not had
							to deal with any drywall dust? How different would my process have been?

					<small class="full-script">
							Has anyone worked with PL/SQL before? I hadn't either, before being hired here. So PL/SQL is what happens when Oracle
							thinks it's a good idea for your database to also handle all your application code. This includes everything from filesystem
							I/O, to LDAP management, to HTTP connections. The one thing it doesn't do, out of the box, is automated testing. So, what was
							the first thing I wrote when I came on board? A lightweight automated testing library so that I, and the whole ERP team could
							start writing tests against our code.

					<small class="full-script">
							If you're not seeing a lot of success through advocacy, teaching or mentoring, try just leading by example. Exhibit what
							you'd like the culture to grow to. Automate all the things. Measure the gains you're making. Most imporantly, share
							your successes, and your failures. Be the CAMS model!

					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							Also be careful. One day pretty early on, definitely within my first year there, I found out I was being moved
							to a different team. While most of me was thrilled to be working with coworkers I was closer with, and on technology
							I was more familiar with, a part of me knew that I had rocked the boat, maybe stepped on some toes, and that this
							was probably a contributing factor to the decision. While I continued to wear my "young hotshot" badge with pride
							-- yes, I actually got called that; I was the youngest on the team by at least a decade -- I realize in hindsight
							that I maybe could have tread a little more lightly.

					<small class="full-script">
							At a higher level, though, team dynamics are paramount, and just because I didn't work well on the ERP team didn't make me
							a bad developer, and it didn't make anyone else on the team a bad developer, it just clearly wasn't the best fit. We
							weren't all trying to go in the same direction. I am glad that management saw this as well, though, because I don't
							know how long I would have lasted otherwise. And so, I moved to the web team, and that's when things started moving
							along.

							This is Go, not the language but the continuous delivery tool, running on a first-generation Intel Power

							Mini that was more powerful, which was good because we continued adding more pipelines, and eventually, when we were

					<small class="full-script">
							Remember the quote from the grad student who said that the online application was so bad they almost didn't apply? We rebuilt it, with
							Angular and Bootstrap and REST APIs, and most importantly, with minimal hooks into the enterprise system. By decoupling the application

						The software successes that we did have all seemed to stem from the idea of decoupling. Decouple the UI from the database

						their graduate application are on a completely different system from the admissions teams reviewing them. Decouple
						your custom features from the vendor software or platform they run on. Creating decoupled systems means smaller, less-risky
						changes, allowing for greater agility moving forward.

					The silver lining in all of this is that now I get to help other organizations improve their practices, processes, and products.
					I'd love to hear about your successes or failures promoting DevOps at your jobs, or if there's any way I can help you
					and your team build better software together. I have all this info in physical form, if you want to bring a souvenir
					back for your boss. If you're more of a sticker person, I've got some Scotch tape right here, so you can stick it on
					your laptop just so. Again, I'm Steve, thank you for having me!
