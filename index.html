						<li>2013, EE company, cool stuff</li>
						<li>dev team + ops guy</li>
						<li>config mgmt, auto deploys, CD</li>
						<li>outgrew, time to move on, saw something</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							OK, so story time. All the way back in 2013, I had been working at a small energy efficiency software company for a few years,
							doing some pretty cool stuff. In addition to being on the dev team, I was also *the* ops guy for most of my time there,
							and managed to get things like configuration management, automated deployments, and continuous delivery in place. Unfortunately, 
							as is sometimes the case, I outgrew that small company and decided it was time to move on. So I looked around, and found something
							that really piqued my interest.

				<h1>Opportunity</h1>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>org struggling to keep up w/user expectations</li>
						<li>self-described "backwater", grad app quote</li>
						<li>potential to make everything better</li>
						<li>first-hand experience</li>
						<li>amped up, turn ship around, guns blazing</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							I saw an organization struggling to keep up with its users' expectations. Self-described as "backwater", with an Online Application
							for Graduate Admission that was, and I quote, "so bad, I almost didn't apply." And I saw the potential of being able to help make
							everything better. After all, I had first-hand experience in how to improve software quality and team performance. And as my start
							date approached, I got myself more and more amped up. I was all like "Yeah! I'm gonna turn this ship around! I'm going in with guns blazing!"

				<h1>Do Not Go In
					<br/> With Guns Blazing

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					There's a reason things are the way they are, and it's probably not by accident.

				<h1>Why?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Stability over innovation</li>
					<li>Control change vs embrace it</li>
					<li>Physical scaling limitations</li>
					<li>Project-centric planning</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>but why though?</li>
						<li>legacy enterprise orgs (define) value stability over innovation</li>
						<li>one way = controlling change (rather than embracing)</li>
						<li>payday example</li>
						<li>research = can have both, but hard, so S wins + I languishes</li>
						<li>budgeting + provisioning hardware limits rollout</li>
						<li>not capital P project = doesn't have priority</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							But why though? Well, with legacy enterprise organizations, and by that I mean enterprise organizations who haven't really
							embraced "the new way" yet, it's because they value stability over innovation. One of the ways they do this is by controlling
							change, rather than embracing it. In some cases, that's with good cause, right? How many of you would be upset if you didn't
							get your paycheck because the payroll system crashed on payday after an upgrade? Research is starting to show that you can have
							both stability and innovation, but it's hard to get there, and so stability wins and innovation languishes. Similarly, when setting
							up a new system means budgeting for new hardware, you're limited in how fast you can roll new things out. I also mentioned the
							project-centric nature of legacy organizations, and this is another contributor: if it's not a capital P project, it doesn't have
							the priority.

				<h1>Lead By Example</h1>
				<h2>"Be the CAMS model!"</h2>

				<aside class="notes">

						<li>*be* the CAMS model</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							If you're not seeing a lot of success through advocacy, teaching or mentoring, try just leading by example. Exhibit what
							you'd like the culture to grow to. Automate all the things. Measure the gains you're making. Most imporantly, share
							your successes, and your failures. Be the CAMS model!

				<h3><b>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</b></h3>
				<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
				<p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
					<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
					<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
					<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

					<small class="full-script">
							This is the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. You may have seen it before. Everyone always focuses on the 4 bullet
							points, but I want to point out that first sentence. "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing
							it and helping others do it." They're talking about experimentation.

					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							This is Go, not the language but the continuous delivery tool, running on a first-generation Intel Power
							Mac under my desk. Literally a spare machine, lying around, brought back to life to live again as a prototype CI server,
							because it was less effort than procuring a new "pre-scaled" server for the physical datacenter. We later found a Mac
							Mini that was more powerful, which was good because we continued adding more pipelines, and eventually, when we were
							able to show the value, we got a real server for it.

							Footprints is your run-of-the-mill legacy/enterprise ticketing system. Look at all those fields! I count 24 on
							this tab alone, and look at all those other tabs! This is where all our work was tracked, as well as where the
							change control process started. Just filling out the form was a whole ordeal in itself. So what did we do?

							Here's an example exchange. This was a real deploy, slightly redacted. I simply ask Todd to update an app to a given tag
							and it gets deployed. What you don't see is everything that already happened that led up to this point. All of these steps --
							the release branch being pushed to QA by the CI server after unit tests pass, automated browser testing against QA, tagging the
							release for staging, deploying to a staging environment identical to production -- previously done manually, starting to be automated
							one by one, by experimenting how to best do it while still maintaining things like auditing requirements, at the same time
							sowing the seeds for continuous delivery.

				<h2>Decouple from your Enterprise Systems</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-gradapp.png" alt="Graduate Application" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>remember grad app quote?</li>
						<li>rebuilt it, Angular, Bootstrap, REST, minimal DB hooks</li>
						<li>by decoupling, minimized risk, abstracted complexity, able to develop with agility</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							Remember the quote from the grad student who said that the online application was so bad they almost didn't apply? We rebuilt it, with
							Angular and Bootstrap and REST APIs, and most importantly, with minimal hooks into the enterprise system. By decoupling the application
							from the underlying database, we minimized risk, we abstracted away the complexity into a more modern API, and we were able to develop with agility.

				<h2>Extend via Configuration,

				</h2>
				<img src="images/ic-myithaca-icpeers.png" alt="Private Social Network" style="width: 75%;" />

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>same w/private social network</li>
						<li>almost impossible to upgrade b/c all customizations</li>
						<li>pulled it all out into configurable modules, plugged into platform</li>
						<li>upgrades became routine, boring (that's the goal, right?)</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							Same with the private social network for prospective students. It was almost impossible to upgrade the underlying framework
							because of all the customization that was built into it. We pulled all that custom behavior and design out into configurable modules
							that could be plugged into the platform, and upgrades suddently became routine; boring, even. But that's the goal, right?

				<aside class="notes full-script">
					Sometimes small changes can have a big impact. The self-service system, where students register for classes, check their
					grades and degree progress, even select their housing, was a specific source of pain for the campus.

					So much so that one student, a freshman at the time, Aaron Zufall, created a Chrome extension to improve the user interface.
					I thought this was great, though unfortunately a Chrome extension doesn't scale to 10,000 users running a dozen different

					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							So we ended up spending two days restyling the app to have a mobile-friendly responsive design. All this compiled into a
							single CSS file running on a separate server, and we just configured the app to use that instead of the original stylesheet.
							Low-risk because the database code didn't need to get touched, low-cost because it was just a couple days of Sass work,
							and high-value because we knew that this was a big issue for students.

				<h1>Lead Times</h1>

						<li>By doing all these things (list) + compound interest earned</li>
						<li>achieved lead times orders of magnitude faster than ERP (over the wall)</li>
						<li>Also able to deploy multiple times per day, compared to couple times a week</li>
						<li>things looking good in web team bubble</li>
					</ul>

					<small class="full-script">
							By doing all of these things -- decoupling our apps, continuous integration, constant communication with ops -- and the compound
							interest we earned when combining them, we achieved lead times that were orders of magnitude faster than the process for ERP
							changes, which were historically more of the traditional "over-the-wall" approach. In doing so, we were also able to deploy multiple
							times per day, compared to a couple times a week. Things were looking pretty good in our little web team bubble!

					<small class="full-script">
							I think it all comes back to this. I couldn't make the organization change any more than I could make our town's culture
							change, in all its hippie, farmers market, terrible traffic on the weekends glory. So what *can* you do? You can spark
							change in others, and I'd like to think I at least did that. You can lead by example, share your wins, pair with others
							to show them the benefits first-hand. And lastly, be patient. Did I just not stick around long enough? Maybe. Are they
							ever going to figure it out? Maybe?
