					<aside class="notes full-script">
						Why am I telling you all this? Well as I've learned, it's important to understand the cultural background of where someone
						comes from. As we get into some definitions, I'm going to be speaking about DevOps in the CAMS model sense of the term:
						Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing. And I'd say that it's a culture *of* automation, measurement, and sharing
						that makes it truly successful.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						When I say "enterprise," I'm going to be talking about organizations whose business is not software, or even IT, but whose
						IT department or division is focused on supporting the business operations of the organization as a whole. In my case,
						that means anything from the payroll and HR systems, to classroom and lab computers and printers, to the on-campus
						network.

						<li>Days of downtime</li>
						<li>Project-centric planning</li>
						<li>Traditional org structure</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						When I talk about "legacy," I'm thinking of the "traditional" ways that IT organizations have operated: Things like on-prem
						datacenters and software, physical servers, or what I like to call "pre-scaled" hardware, upgrades that can take systems
						down for days at a time, projet-centric planning, and a traditional org structure.

				<section>
					<h1>Story Time</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						OK, so story time. All the way back in 2013, I was working at a small energy efficiency software company, doing some pretty
						cool stuff. In addition to being on the dev team, I was also "the" ops guy for most of my time there, and managed to
						get things like configuration management and automated deployments in place. Unfortunately, as is sometimes the case,
						I outgrew that small company and decided it was time to move up. So I looked around, and found something that really
						piqued my interest.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Opportunity</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						I saw an organization struggling to keep up with its users' expectations. Described as "backwater", with an Online Application
						for Graduate Admission that was, and I quote, "so bad, I almost didn't apply." And I saw the potential of being able
						to help make everything better. After all, I'd participated in and seen first-hand how things like configuration management
						and continuous delivery could do. As my start date approached, I got myself all amped up, right? "I'm gonna turn this
						ship around. I'm going in with guns blazing!"

					<h1>Part 1</h1>
					<h2>Do Not Go In
						<br/> With Guns Blazing

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						There's a reason things are the way they are, and it's probably not by accident.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Every Org Is Different</h1>
					<h2>Different Orgs Work Differently</h2>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						I'm gonna start with some real easy ones. I wish it were that obvious at the time, but I'll pretend I was young and naive.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>By the Numbers</h1>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>1,800 employees</li>
						<li>7,000 students</li>
						<li>10,000 prospects</li>
						<li>100,000 alumni</li>
						<li>300,000 www visitors</li>
						<br/>
						<li>70 IT Department</li>
						<li>8 developers</li>
						<li>9 admins</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						Some numbers for this specific institution, and keep in mind these are all different types of users, with different needs,
						that all need to be supported: 1800 employees, that includes both faculty and staff; about 7000 students at any given
						time; 10000 prospective students a year; more than 100000 alumni; and about 300000 annual visitors to the public website.
						The IT department had about 70 people at the time, including 8 developers, and 9 on what we would traditionally consider
						"ops."

					<h2>Big Orgs Move Slow</h2>
					<img src="images/typescript.png" alt="TypeScript approval at Google" style="width: 75%;" />
					<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/T6006-R1" target="_blank">https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/T6006-R1</a>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						So, not that we were *that* big, but big enough that it was a culture shock for me, coming from a smaller company prior.
						Continuing along the company size spectrum, Rob Wormald from Google's Angular team gave a talk at Microsoft Build a
						couple months back, and he mentioned how it took them two years to get TypeScript approved as a language that could
						be used company-wide. So if you're part of a big org, and things are moving slow, you're not alone, it's apparently
						just the nature of the beast.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Why?</h1>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Stability over innovation</li>
						<li>Physical scaling limitations</li>
						<li>Project-centric planning</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						But why though? Well, with legacy enterprise organizations, and by that I mean enterprise organizations who haven't really
						embraced "the new way" yet, it's because they value stability over innovation, and in some cases with good cause. How
						many of you would be upset if you didn't get your paycheck because the payroll system crashed? Obviously things like
						the State of DevOps Report and what DORA is doing are proving that you can do both, but it's hard, and so stability
						wins and innovation languishes. Similarly, when setting up a new system means budgeting for new hardware, you're limited
						in how fast you can roll things out. I also mentioned the project-centric nature of legacy organizations, and this
						is another contributor to the falling behind.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Software is not a Building</h1>
					<h2>Don't construct them the same way</h2>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						Projects, by definition, have a beginning and an end. Software, as many are still discovering, is constantly evolving. Yes,
						new software is created, and it eventually is sunset, but in that time it can grow tremendously, and as such, should
						not be constrained to the limitations of the physical world. While this may be easy for you to grasp, many still don't
						see it that way, so here's an example I like to use.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="images/office.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes full-script">
						This is my home office. Things had to be done in a very specific order. For the ceiling alone, electical wiring, lights,
						insulation, resilient channel, A/V wiring (it's also a home theater) drywall, taping, primer, paint, crown molding.
						If I forgot a step and moved on, it would be difficult and expensive to remedy. And so you do the planning up-front
						to make sure you have all your ducks in a row. This is waterfall development, right? And in the days of shrinkwrapped
						software, that was how it had to be done, because once you shipped, there was no turning back. But we're not in that
						time anymore, and so we need our processes to adjust accordingly.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>PL/SQL</h1>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Filesystem I/O</li>
						<li>LDAP management</li>
						<li>HTTP connections</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						Has anyone worked with PL/SQL before? So PL/SQL is what happens when Oracle thinks it's a good idea for your database to
						also handle all your application code. This includes everything from filesystem I/O, to LDAP management, to HTTP connections.
						The one thing it doesn't do, out of the box, is automated testing. So, what was one of the first things I wrote when
						I came on board? A lightweight automated testing library so that I, and the team could start writing tests against
						our code.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Be Prepared
						<br/> For More Resistance
						<br/> Than You Can Imagine
					</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						I get it. Right out of college, 2007, I didn't see the point of spending more time writing more code for something I could
						check quicker by hand. This is one of the most common arguments against automated testing, and for me at least, it
						wasn't until I saw that first failing test in unrelated code, that the value really hit me. The resistance doesn't
						usually come in the form of active refusal so much as apathy towards being forced to change long-lived habits. So how
						do you convince others? I like to lead by example. Share the knowledge. Show everyone the value first-hand. It will
						take a long time, but with patience, slowly others will come around.

					<h1>Assume Awesomeness</h1>
					<a href="https://github.com/BeardedCoder/RealWorldRetros" target="_blank">https://github.com/BeardedCoder/RealWorldRetros</a>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						That said, it's important to try to remember that your colleagues probably aren't being purposely malicious or defiant. You
						need to "assume awesomeness" -- that, whatever their current situation is, they're trying their hardest to do the best
						job they can. Everyone on your team is. This is something I heard from a presentation by a Canadian developer named
						Sean Yo, and it has really stuck with me through the years.

					<h1>Team Dynamics Are Important</h1>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						The flip side of that is that team dynamics are important, and just because I didn't work well on the ERP team didn't make
						me a bad developer, and it didn't make anyone else on the team a bad developer, it just wasn't the best fit. And I'm
						glad that management saw that as well, because I don't know how long I would have lasted otherwise. And so, I got moved
						to the web team, and that's when things started moving along.

					<h2>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h2>
					<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
					<p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
						<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
						<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
						<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
					</ul>
					<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						This is the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. You may have seen it before. Everyone always focuses on the 4 bullet
						points, but I want to point out that first sentence. "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing
						it and helping others do it." They're talking about experimentation.

					<h1>Small Controlled Experiments</h1>
					<a href="http://verraes.net/2014/03/small-controlled-experiments/" target="_blank">http://verraes.net/2014/03/small-controlled-experiments/</a>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						This is an article by Mathias Verraes: Student of Systems, Meddler of Models, Laborer of Legacy. He's a Belgian developer
						I met at a conference just before this was published. In it, he goes over some steps for spending just a small amount
						of time each day experimenting and improving. It's along the same lines as Deming's PDCA cycle, or Toyota's Improvement
						Kata, but on a much smaller scale. Low-cost, low-risk, easy to implement or easy to revert. Kaizen, continuous improvement,
						should be at the heart of these experiments.

				<section data-background-image="images/footprints.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes full-script">
						This is Footprints. It's your run-of-the-mill legacy/enterprise ticketing system. Look at all those fields! I count 24 on
						just this tab, and look at all those other tabs! This is where all our work was tracked. It took minutes to lookup,
						add, or edit a task, it had minimal visualization options, and had terrible cross-browser compatibility. So what did
						we do?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="images/trello.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes full-script">
						We tried an experiment. We kept our customer communication in Footprints, but switched to Trello for our day-to-day task
						management. The first step we tried was making a Kanban board in Footprints, but it was still too clunky and not configurable
						enough, so we went to Trello. It was a little bit to get used to, having to manage multiple tracking systems and keep
						certain information in sync, but the daily workflow improvements were well worth it. I heard someone in the peanut
						gallery just shout "show me the metrics!" Good thing I've got those! Weekly sprint planning, for example, we'd have
						about a dozen tasks. In Footprints, marking each of those as planned for the current sprint took 10 seconds. Trello,
						a 2 second drag-and-drop. So an 8 second difference times 12 tasks is a minute and a half. Not that much, but do that
						for a year, and you've wasted an hour of 3 or 4 people's time literally waiting for the browser to reload. Not to mention
						it breaking the flow of the weekly planning meeting.

						Here's a picture of another one of our experiments: this is Go, the continuous delivery tool, running on a first-generation
						Intel Power Mac under my desk. This photo was taken in late 2014, which means the Mac was at least 4 years old, given
						when they were discontinued. Literally a spare machine, lying around, brought back to life to live again as a prototype
						CI server, because it was less effort than procuring a new "pre-scaled" server for the physical datacenter. We later
						found a Mac Mini that was more powerful, which was good because we continued adding more pipelines, and eventually,
						when we were able to show the value, we got a real server for it.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						"Now wait a minute," you might be saying, "you can't just willy-nilly deploy updates to an enterprise system!" And you're
						probably right. But we didn't do that. Remember the quote from the grad student who said that the online application

						Same with the private social network for prospective students. It was almost impossible to upgrade the underlying framework
						because of all the customizations that were built into it. We pulled out all that custom behavior and design into modules

						<p>You can have your cake and eat it too!</p>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						It was around this time that the term "Bimodal IT" found its way to our organization. "Bimodal IT" comes from Gartner, and
						is the idea that in order to succeed in the new world of user expectations, your IT organization neds to operate two
						different ways in parallel. Mode 1 is for your traditional, predictable service requests, Mode 2 is for when there
						are more unknowns and iteration is necessary. This immediately raised two red flags for me. Number one: while this
						seems reasonable for a legacy organization, but for me, coming from the other direction, I was like "hold up, why isn't
						everything mode 2? If it's predictable, it should be automated, and then becomes an exploration of how best to automate."
						Number two is the false dichotomy that speed and stability are a trade-off. This is becoming clearer now, with the
						State of DevOps Report, etc. While Bimodal IT may be a good first step for those just getting started, it seemed like
						a step backwards from my past experience, and I tried to be vocal about that.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						A series of mishaps led to the creation of a "DevOps Strategy Team," whose charge was to deliver a presentation to senior
						management about why it was worth investing in DevOps. Now, set aside the fact that we were already off on the wrong
						foot by having a "DevOps Team," I was at least glad to see management opening up to the idea of some fundamental change.
						Unfortunately, there was no clear direction, and everyone had a different idea of what DevOps meant and the problems
						is was supposed to solve. If I were to go back and do this again, I would make sure everyone is on the same page about
						what we're trying to accomplish, with a very succinct definition, examples even, and metrics to show how to tell if
						we're on the right track. We didn't have any of these, and so the whole initiative fell apart.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						And then came the dreaded R word. It was clear to me, and everyone, that the organization needed some big changes. Unfortunately
						they were not what I was expecting. Or maybe deep down they were. The ops team got pulled further away from the dev
						team, and it became clear that the focus of the organization was shifting from service provider to service broker.
						This meant less of an emphasis on software development and more of an emphasis on off-the-shelf configuration and administration.
						Obviously not the thing a developer wants to hear.

						Except I don't believe that either. The longer you hold off, the further behind you're going to be. Yes, those who are risk-averse
						might save some time by letting others do the trail blazing, but that time has long come and gone. So if DevOps is
						the right move, and now's the time, what happened?

						I think it all comes back to this. I couldn't make the organization want to change any more than I could make our town's
						culture change. So what *can* you do? You can spark change in others, and I'd like to think I at least did that. You
						can lead by example, share your wins, pair with others to show them the benefits first-hand. And lastly, be patient.
						Did I just not stick around long enough? Maybe. Are they ever going to figure it out? Maybe.

					<aside class="notes full-script">
						The successes that we did have all seemed to stem from the idea of decoupling. Decouple the UI from the database so the code
						is more modular. Decouple the front-end from the back-end, and by this I mean the offices: the users completing their
						graduate application are using a completely different system from the admissions teams reviewing them. Decouple your
						custom features from the vendor software or platform they run on. Creating decoupled systems means smaller, less-risky
						changes, allowing for greater agility moving forward.

						I'm currently lucky enough to be able to take my kids on weekly hikes, and a couple weeks ago, when I took this picture,
						I was trying to figure out how to sum all this up into a single thought. Now, sometimes, like on this day, things go
						smoothly: everyone's in a good mood, we make good progress...other times, they're distractable, reluctant, and it takes
						a lot more coercing to get everyone going. And it probably has somewhat to do with how I'm leading them. So if I had
						one final piece of advice to instill today, it would be this:

						The silver lining in all of this is that now I get to help other organizations improve their practices, processes, and products.
